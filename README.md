## Business Case

Your hometown mayor just created a new data analysis team to give policy advice, and the administration recruited _you_ via LinkedIn to join it. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, for now the "team" is just you...

The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!

## Directions

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions. What you do in this project are good practices for all projects going forward, especially those after this bootcamp!

Spend your time trying to understand your data, through both summary statistics and visualization. By the end, you will want to be familiar enough with the datasets that you can think of testable hypotheses that could point in specific policy directions.

We will be looking for the following things:

- For statistics questions, Python code -- using pandas, numpy, scipy, and/or other libraries -- to calculate correct answers, with Markdown explaining your results
- For plotting questions, labeled seaborn or matplotlib plots displayed within your notebook, with Markdown interpreting the results

## Dataset Description

---

drug-use-by-age.csv

- 17 rows, 28 columns (imported)
- n is sample size (number of people in age group)

sat_scores.csv

- 53 rows, 4 columns
- Rate is the participation rate, 0-100%

---

## Requirements

- Materials must be in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook.
- Students should demonstrate the ability to:

1. Analyze diverse datasets & explicitly state your assumptions.
2. Form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy. 
3. Visualize and interpret your plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

For all projects, students will be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0-3 inclusive). Instructors will use this rubric when scoring student performance on each of the core project **requirements:** 

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again._
**1** | _Approaching expectations. Getting there..._
**2** | _Meets expecations. Great job._
**3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_

For project 1 the evaluation categories are as follows:

- **Organization**:	Clearly commented, annotated and sectioned Jupyter notebook or Python script.  Comments and annotations add clarity, explanation and intent to the work.  Notebook is well-structured with title, author and sections. Assumptions are stated and justified.
- **Charting**:	Charts (from Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) are created and used correctly. The appropriate charts are used in context.  Charts are created and accessed using appropriate mechanisms.
- **Probability and Statistics**:	Descriptive and inferential statistics are calculated and applied where appropriate.  Probabilistic reasoning is demonstrated.  There is a clear understanding of how probability and statistics affects the analysis being performed.
- **Pandas**: 	Appropriate pandas methods are used in answering questions.

## Useful Resources

- Here's a [cheatsheet](https://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_dataframe_descriptive_stats.html) of descriptive statistics methods in Pandas.

- Making good plots can take a lot of trial-and-error (especially with matplotlib). The [seaborn example gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/) may help you find the right code, and decide what you want to do in the first place.

- Inferential statistics and hypothesis testing can get very nuanced. It is okay to violate some of the assumptions underlying the methods you've learned. But be explicit about why you've chosen a particular method, and what the drawbacks may be.
